		<h3>Functions of Blood:</h3><br>
		<ul>
			<li>supplying oxygen to cells and tissues providing essential nutrients to cells, such as 	amino acids, fatty acids, and glucose removing waste materials, such as carbon dioxide,urea, and lactic acid.</li>
			<li>Protecting the body from infection and foreign bodies through the white blood cells.</li>
			<li>Transporting hormones from one part of the body to another, transmitting messages, and completing important processes.</li>
			<li>Regulating acidity (pH) levels and body temperature</li>
			<li>Engorging parts of the body when needed, for example, a penile erection as a response to sexual arousal.</li>
			<li>Another important function of the blood is its protective action against disease. White blood cells defend the body against infections, foreign materials, and abnormal cells.</li>
			<li>The platelets in blood enable the clotting, or coagulation, of blood. When bleeding occurs, the platelets group together to create a clot. The clot becomes a scab and stops the bleeding, as well as helping to protect the wound from infection.</li>
